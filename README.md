## What's the need?
Based on Saudi 2030 Vision and the Saudi Green Initiative, which aims to protect the environment and reduce the effects of climate change, there was a need to provide a solution that would contribute to the involvement of all sectors of society in afforestation, reduce climate changes and raise the quality of human life.


## Project family
All the team members worked together as a one family in every single piece of the project, everyone had so much fun and learned from each others.

## Proposed solution
We have developed Gheras app, which allows user to create an account and request the plants after navigate the map and see other users plants, which spreads the spirit of competition and fun.

## Strengths points
**Arabic:** The app targeted the Saudi and middle east culture, so it designed using Arabic language. 
**Compete:** Each user has points and badges, and there are a section in the app shows the top users. 
**All community:** The application based mainly on the principle of "Gamefication" which will urge all society with all ages and backgrounds to enjoy using the application and spending time in it, "every one like to play" which will support our goal during a record period of time.
